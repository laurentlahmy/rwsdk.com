								<br />
								That moment has sparked millions of journeys.
								<br />
								Kids in bedrooms. Students in labs. Curious minds in internet

								<br />A generation &ndash; and then another &ndash; learned the
								magic of software.
								<br />
								They stayed up too late.
								<br />
								They built games. Tools. Mods. Scripts to make life easier.
								<br />
								They shared zip files on forums. Burned CDs for friends.

								Suddenly, we have massive platforms backed by massive money.{" "}

								We got jobs.

								We went to stand ups.
								<br />
								We joined sprint planning calls and added tickets to Jira.
								<br />
								Software became a business.

								What if writing software was like picking up a power drill

								Not a startup. Not a business. Not a side hustle. <br />
								Just a piece of software that works. That's yours. That you own.

								AI is lowering the barrier to entry.

								Serverless hosting is erasing the friction.

								Frameworks like Redwood are simplifying the plumbing.

								You don't need to ask permission anymore.

								You don't need to scale.

								You don't need to monetize.

								We started Redwood to help developers build faster.

								To reduce friction. To accelerate creation.

								Now, we're going further.

								We want to be the toolkit - and the movement - behind personal

								<br />
								Software you can build, own, share, and modify (like it used to
								be).
								<br />
								Software that solves your problem.
								<br />
								Software that doesn't try to lock you in or track your usage or
								upsell you into a higher tier.

								Because here's the thing:

								The Personal Software Revolution

							<p className="text-base lg:text-md leading-8 font-light">
								We believe software can be personal again.
								<br />
								Not just technically, but philosophically.
								<br />
								Owned. Forkable. Shareable. Local. Beautiful.
								<br />
								Built for use, not for scale.
								<br />
								Built with love, not venture funding.
								<br />
								Built for yourself - and maybe a few others.
								<br />
								If this resonates with you, come join us. We're not just
								building a framework. <br />
								<strong className="font-bold">
									We're building a future where software is yours again.
