# Redwood is sponsoring Johannes from LiveStore

Following in the footsteps of Clerk’s [Open Source Fellowship](https://clerk.com/blog/zod-fellowship) program and their sponsorship of Zod, we’re thrilled to announce a sister project! We’ll be sponsoring [Johannes Schickling](https://x.com/schickling) from [LiveStore](https://livestore.dev/) to build an adapter for Cloudflare.

At first glance, it might seem surprising for RedwoodSDK to sponsor LiveStore. After all, LiveStore is a data layer that brings data closer to the UI—traditionally a server’s job, and we're a server-first framework. But this collaboration isn’t about putting everything on the client. It’s about giving users control over their data, ensuring it’s always accessible, synchronised, and close to them.

To us, the Local-First movement isn’t just about declaring the client as the sole source of truth. It’s about empowering users with offline access, low latency, and true data ownership. We believe Cloudflare’s Durable Objects strike the perfect balance—colocating data near the user at the edge and enabling seamless sync with the client. This lets users become the guardians of their own data, not passive participants in a system where access is gated and abstracted away.

By combining LiveStore’s real-time architecture with Cloudflare’s edge-first infrastructure, we’re building a foundation where software is personal, resilient, and responsive—while remaining easy to deploy, scale, and sync across users and devices. It’s a new kind of web where your data stays close, your experience feels instant, and you’re always in control.
